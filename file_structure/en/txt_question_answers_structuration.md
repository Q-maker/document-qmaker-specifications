# How to structure a txt file to contain question and answers.
The question-answer txt files are structured to contain one to several sections of questions and answer proposals.
How structured a question and answer section?
Let's learn by example; see the question-answer section below:

```
Among the animals,
which of these animals comes into the water?
-Cat
-The dog
*Fish
-horse
> Fish are aquatic animals that populate
mothers, oceans, rivers, ponds and water points.
```

By this example, we can highlight that:
   * A section always begins with the wording of the question, it can be written under more lines.
    However, no line break is accepted (white line corresponding to two line breaks)
   * The proposed answers follow the wording of the question and are arranged so that:
            -The true propositions are preceded by an asterix (*)

            -The false propositions are preceded by a dash (-)

            NB: Propositions can also be written in several lines (without line breaks)
   * In the last position we have the comment: it must be preceded by the symbol (>) and can also be written on several lines without line break



This is how a question and answer section is composed.
However, a questionnaire is composed of one to several sections of question answering. to do this, simply separate each question-answer section with a line break;
that is, returned twice to the line (those that result in an empty line).
Below is an example with a set of two (2) answer question sections. (Note the empty line between the two sections)

```
Among the following animals,
which of these animals comes into the water?
-Cat
-The dog
*Fish
-horse
> Fish are aquatic animals that populate
mothers, oceans, rivers, ponds and water points.

Which of these animals are flying?
*Pigeon
-The dog
*The crow
*The Eagle
> The pigeon, the raven and the eagle are all flying birds
```
