# What is the challenge mode?
Like a <b>game against the clock</b>, questions are proposed to you one after another.
You must answer in time.

If the time allotted to the question is exceeded or if you choose an answer , the application tells you if it is <i>true</i> or <i>false </i> and then displays a correction (<i>according to whether the questionnaire configuration allows it or not.</i>) and <b>automatically</b> move to the next <b>question</b>.

### How it works?
The duration of each question is automatically calculated so as to be equal to the total duration of the questionnaire divided by the number of questions that will be proposed to the player (<i>Time per question = Total duration of the questionnaire / number of questions per session </i>)

About answer proposals displayed to the user, the application will choose a maximum of four (4) random answers from all those available for this question.

Also, for each question, the application will choose one and only one (1) true answer among all the true answers available for that question.

Thus, in challenge mode, a maximum of four (4) answer proposals are proposed with only one (1) true answer selected at random from the available answer proposals for this question; All to be completed in a time frame = <i>Total duration of the questionnaire / number of questions per session</i>


### What are the upcoming features?
In the next updates, several configuration parameters will be added to the challenge mode in order to offer to questionnaire author
more flexibility in editing the behavior of a questionnaire in challenge mode.
It will then be possible to:
   * Specifically configure the time per question
   * Allow to manage the cases of multiple answers in challenge mode
   * Configure the maximum number of answer proposals to display to the player (<i>default = 4</i>)
   * Configure the maximum number of true answer proposals to display to the player during an exercise/quiz (<i>default = 1</i>).

But also:
   * Configure the preferential mode (<i>recommended mode</i>) of reading: Exam or challenge.
   * Configure if a *.qcm file can be run or not in Challenge mode
   * Configure if a *.qcm file can be run or not in Exam mode

Much more:
   * Define an audio to play in loop along the challenge
   * Define an audio to play on success answering.
   * Define an audio to play on partial success answering (in case of more than one good answer).
   * Define an audio to play during a wrong answer.
   * Define an audio to play at the end of the challenge.
